Okay, so I kinda zoned out of coding for, like, 6-7 months. Life, school, and all that teenage drama got in the way, but I'm back! JavaScript and CSS might need a quick review to refresh my memory, but HTML's still fresh. So, I'm reviewing all the projects I made in The Odin Project one by one to understand them. I don't think re-doing them is necessary and probably a waste of time.
