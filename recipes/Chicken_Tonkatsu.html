   <p>A recipe for delicious Japanese fried chicken and an accompanying Tonkatsu sauce. Serve with your choice of shredded cabbage, rice, or even mashed potatoes.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
        <h4>
            sauce
        </h4>
        <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
        <h4>Chicken</h4>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil, for deep-fat frying</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch thickness</li>
        <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Directions</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>step 1</li>
    <p>For the sauce, stir together the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and soy sauce, and a pinch of pepper to taste. Set aside.</p>
    <li>step 2</li>
    <p>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>Place flour and panko bread crumbs onto separate plates and season with salt and pepper. Place the beaten egg in a medium bowl. Dip flattened chicken pieces first into flour, then egg, and lastly bread crumbs.</p>
    <li>Step 4</li>
    <p>Fry breaded chicken breasts in preheated oil until golden brown and no longer pink in center, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. Slice chicken into thin strips and top with a drizzle of sauce and a sprinkling of sliced green onions. Serve remaining sauce on the side for dipping.</p>
